# Mutation Observer Example

This is a basic example using a mutation observer with [SWAPI](https://swapi.dev/)

I wrote a blog post explaining this in full detail [here](https://jakewantulok.com/mutation-observer).

Make sure you have installed [bud≈ç](https://www.npmjs.com/package/budo) first. Then install the repo and start the server.

```bash
npm install budo -g
npm install
npm start
```
